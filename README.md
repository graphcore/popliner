# PopLiner - Auto-Pipelining Library

> Copyright 2021 Graphcore Ltd.

PopLiner is a command line tool and library used to determine optimal split points to use when
pipelining a large model.

This software is licensed under the MIT license, see LICENSE.txt for more details.

### Setup

PopLiner requires Python 3.6 or newer.  It depends on a few Python packages which can be installed
using `pip`:

```cmd
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Before using PopLiner you must have an active Poplar installation.  See the
[Poplar SDK documentation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-pod-getting-started/en/latest/installation.html#setting-up-the-sdk-environment)
for more details.  Poplar SDK version 2.5 or higher is required.  You can
activate the poplar installation in the `bash` shell as follows:

```cmd
source /path/to/poplar/install/enable.sh
```

You will need to reactivate the poplar installation each time you open a new terminal window.

### Running PopLiner

PopLiner can be run as follows, where `PROFILE_PATH` is the path to the profile generated by
poplar.  Output will be written to the `out.tsv` file.

```cmd
./popliner.py PROFILE_PATH/profile.pop PROFILE_PATH/debug.cbor >out.tsv
```

The inputs to PopLiner are a `profile.pop` and a `debug.cbor` file.  These are created by the
profiling functionality built in to Poplar.  By default PopLiner outputs tab-separated output
containing spreadsheet formulae.

PopLiner has the following options:

 - `-h`, `--help` Show a help message listing the available options
 - `--format {tsv,csv,json}` Select the format of the output
   - `tsv` Tab-separated values with spreadsheet formulae
   - `csv` Comma-separated values without spreadsheet formulae
   - `json` JSON format, intended to be consumed by other scripts or tools.  Only produced if `--solve` is used.
 - `--memory_totals` Print total memory by category.
 - `--solve` Solve for split points (beta).
 - `--num-ipus NUM_IPUS` When solving, the number of IPUs in the system (default=4).
 - `--mem_per_tile MEM_PER_TILE` When solving, the memory per tile in bytes (default=624kB).
 - `--batch_size BATCH_SIZE` When solving, the batch size (default=2).
 - `--operation_breakdown` Outputs a memory breakdown per operation.
 - `--memory_affinity` For each layer pair, outputs the size of shared variables.
 - `--interlayer_communication` For each layer pair, outputs the size of variables
   created in the first layer and consumed in the second one.

### Running the tests

After a poplar installation is activated and Python dependencies have been installed, tests can
be run using pytest:

```cmd
pytest
```
